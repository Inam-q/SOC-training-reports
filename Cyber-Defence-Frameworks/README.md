# üõ°Ô∏è Cyber Defence Frameworks

This folder contains reports and summaries of widely used **Cyber Defence Models and Frameworks** that guide Security Operations, Threat Hunting, and Incident Response.  
These documents provide structured approaches to detect, analyze, and mitigate cyber threats.

## üìÇ Reports Included

1. **Cyber Kill Chain**  
   - Developed by Lockheed Martin.  
   - Describes the 7 stages of a cyber attack, from Reconnaissance to Actions on Objectives.  
   - Helps analysts identify and disrupt attacks at different phases.

2. **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis**  
   - Focuses on understanding attacks through four core features: Adversary, Infrastructure, Capability, and Victim.  
   - Useful in threat hunting and adversary attribution.

3. **MITRE ATT&CK**  
   - A globally accessible knowledge base of adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).  
   - Used by SOCs, threat hunters, and red/blue teams to map and defend against attacks.

4. **Pyramid of Pain**  
   - Introduced by David Bianco.  
   - Explains the value of different types of indicators (hashes, IPs, domains, TTPs).  
   - Shows defenders how making life harder for attackers requires going beyond simple indicators.

5. **Unified Kill Chain**  
   - Extends the Lockheed Martin Kill Chain + MITRE ATT&CK.  
   - Provides a more complete view of both offensive and defensive operations.  

6. **Eviction**  
   - Framework describing strategies for removing adversaries from compromised environments.  
   - Focuses on containment, eradication, and recovery stages of incident response.

7. **Summit**  
   - A framework emphasizing collaborative defense, analyst skill development, and continuous improvement in SOC operations.

8. **Junior Security Analyst Intro**  
   - Beginner-friendly introduction to core SOC frameworks and methodologies.  
   - Designed to help new analysts understand how frameworks connect to real-world SOC work.

## üéØ Purpose
These frameworks provide a structured foundation for:
- Threat detection & response  
- Adversary emulation & threat hunting  
- Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows  
- Incident response planning  
- Blue team defense strategies
